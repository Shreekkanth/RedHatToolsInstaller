# Whats "ip=" variables for?
# ==========================
# We have used these for our statically configured network without DHCP/DNS
# server which was running on 10Gb ethernet (compared 1Gb etherned which had
# all the comfort of DHCP/DNS). This 10Gb ethernet was preffered to run our
# tests. If you have only one network in your setup with functional DNS/DHCP
# servers, you most probably do not need these values.
#
# Variable "containers="
# ======================
# Only applicable to "docker-host" group member and defines number of
# containers docker-tierup.yaml should start on a given host.
#
# Variable "not_yet_10g_nic="
# ===========================
# Set this to 'true' if there is no 10G network interface on the system yet,
# so "common" role wont try to check it.
#
# Variable "docker_host_10gnic="
# ==============================
# Set to name of the interface to add to the docker0 bridge. Defaults
# to "eth1".
#
# Variable "docker_host_cidr_range="
# ==================================
# How big should be docker's '--fixed-cidr' range? Defaults to 24 which is
# enough for 255 containers. If you plan, say, 1000 containers, set to 22
# and make sure to allocate space in IP space (if first docker host have
