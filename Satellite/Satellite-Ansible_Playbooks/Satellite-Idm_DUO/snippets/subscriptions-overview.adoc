== Subscriptions overview
Three factors play an important part in selecting the right RHEL subscription:

* the SLA
* the number of Sockets and
* the number of virtual machines.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux can have layered products, like clustering. These require a separate subscription.

=== Service level agreement
An important part of a subscription is access to Red Hat support. The SLA part of a subscription plays an important part for the customer here as this defines response times.

=== Socket pairs
A RHEL subscription is based upon socket-pairs. A socket meant here is the CPU socket.
Any subset of one or two sockets counts for one pair, so a node with 16 cores and two sockets requires one subscription to be compliant. A node with four sockets requires two subscriptions of one socket pair.
A node with one socket will then require one subscription to be compliant, and a node with three sockets will require two subscriptions.

Off course, exceptions rule, so a node with four physical sockets of which only two have a seated CPU, will require just one subscription to be compliant.

=== virtualization
Any subscription for RHEL can be used for virtual machines. The number of Virtual machines included with a subscription is two.
One subscription which would apply to a _physical_ dual socket machine. It can also be used for two virtual machines â€“ it doesn't not matter how many vCPUs are used in that case.

==== Virtual Datacenter Subscriptions
Next to regular subscriptions, there is also a relevance for Virtual Datacenter Subscriptions (VDC) here. +
This uses a parent-child relation: the parent (the hypervisor) consumes a subscription while the children (the VMs running on that particular hypervisor) piggy back on that subscription and are provided with a valid subscription.

A VDC subscription is only valid for virtual machines, not for hypervisors, and is available per socket-pair.

=== Layered products
Layered products need the same SLA and number of socket-pairs as the RHEL these products are deployed upon.

=== Red Hat Enterprise Linux life cycle
.life cycle phases
image::{imagesdir}/Subscriptions/lifecycle_phases.png[pdfwidth=80%]
The Life-cycle has different fases with different types of support. Depending on the applications, the deployment of nodes could be aligned with the different phases; deploy in production 1, maintain in production 2 and replace in production 3 would be an ideal model.

==== Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 Extended Life-cycle Support
The Extended Life-cycle support phases for RHEL5 will begin March 31, 2017. Without this, support cannot be provided to RHEL5, so RHEL5 will not have a valid subscription. As Red Hat uses the _all or nothing_ principle, using RHEL5 without ELS would mean RHEL5 is valid, which in turn invalidates all other subscription.
