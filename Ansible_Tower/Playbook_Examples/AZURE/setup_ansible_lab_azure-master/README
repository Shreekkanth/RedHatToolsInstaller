Make sure your license can manage enough nodes. Each participants uses 2 nodes (localhost and an external IP)
Send an email to sales@ansible.com


2/ Copy inventory.example to inventory and fill in the missing parameters

Some parameters can be found from Azure CLI as follows:
# from Shell in Azure
# PS Azure:\> az ad sp create-for-rbac --query '{"client_id": appId, "secret": password, "tenant": tenant}'
# {
#   "client_id": "***",
#   "secret": "***",
#   "tenant": "***"
# }


3/ id_rsa will be used to pull the scripts from gitlab. Make sure id_rsa.pub is added as key


4/ Run "ansible-playbook tower_setup_azure.yml
   to save time when tower is already installed: 
   ansible-playbook tower_setup_azure.yml --skip-tags install_tower
